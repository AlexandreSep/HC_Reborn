					"History": "The fifth Princess to bear the name Zelda, Tetralyna comes from a long line of royalty composing the Kingdom's second dynasty. She is one of the youngest rulers to ascend to the throne, at just the age of eighteen. Princess Zelda was known to be extremely cautious, preferring to ponder in wisdom before acting out. She is occasionally aided by powerful premonitions, and will often wait to see if such visions give her foresight of a situation."

					"History": "Link is a descendant of King Gustaf and the heir to his lost First Dynasty. After Gustaf and his wife Siroc's children were chased into hiding by the false Goddess Hylia, they maintained secrecy over countless generations and hid their lineage. At a young age, Link's father was killed and he was then raised by his mother and uncle. When the Gerudo Wars claimed both their lives, the Order of the Wizzrobe adopted him under the suspicion that he was the lost heir of Gustaf. Hylia personally trained Link before unleashing him unto Hyrule to do her bidding."

Feeling unfullfilled with her humble clergy role, Lana studied more esoteric magics in secret with the help of the shady Wizzrobes in Byrna. Though her loyaties to the crown and Hyrule are not in question, many including Rauru feel her immense powers are more than enough for her to control."

Rauru later oversaw the construction of the Temple of Time with the ancient Oocca.
