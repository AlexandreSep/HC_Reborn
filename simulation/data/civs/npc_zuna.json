Though they seem fairly cordial with the Darknut Legion, the Zuna will rarely make contact with any other empire or race outside of weapon dealings. The skill with which the Zuna make their weapons is legendary, so legendary that the Darknut Legion employs them to create incredibly ornate swords for their soldiers. Despite their famous profession, the Zuna rarely ever engage in warfare and their public army usually only operates out of defense.",

While he may be seen as a total coward by outsiders, his habit of selling out to foreigners has lead to the Zuna becoming a giant merchant empire and biggest arms dealer in all of Hyrule."
