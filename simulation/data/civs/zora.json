					"Name": "King Zora De Bon XVI",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Battlecrab",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The latest in a long line of monarchs of the Dominion, King Zora Farkos is a rather undignified ruler who abuses his station of power. He has been responsible for several unnecessary expansion campaigns, one of which lead to a full invasion of Death Mountain. King Farkos is known as quite a selfish individual who shuns tradition. He unlawfully married the half-breed Zora, Rutela, only to divorce her and thereby pollute the royal bloodline, and splinter the Dominion into two empires."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Princess Ruto, Sage of Water",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Ice and Water Magic",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The daughter of King Farkos and Queen Rutela, Ruto’s bloodline was polluted by their union, as is evidenced by her eyes. Despite this, she retains her title, and inheritance of the Dominion throne, after the divorce of her two parents. An accident that nearly killed her early in adulthood has led to her adopting Sagehood. To this day, she is one of the youngest Sages to have lived. Ruto is known for her very fiesty and aggressive personality, in some cases being described as a total brat. Despite this demeanor, she withholds a lifelong sadness after the splitting of her parents, that she tries to cure by finding a husband; a venture she often spectacularly fails in."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Ambassador Zaleen",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Hidden Fin Blades",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "For many years, Zaleen has served as Ambassador between the Dominion and its many neighbors. He is perhaps the most well-versed in Hyrulean lore and cultures, due in part to help from his wife’s library of information. Zaleen was a very close friend of Ruto’s during childhood, however an accident that he was involved in nearly killed her, and resulted in her adoption into Sagehood. Since then he has maintained emotional (and literal) distance from her and has grown antagonistic to her rise to the throne."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Telara, Headmaster Historian",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Healing Magic",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "Initially trained as a Mage, Telara left the Communion in order to live a less hostile life. She eventually married Zaleen and became a librarian in Domain Prime, assembling historial documents and compiling much of the information that would be later used in Midna’s Hyrule Historia Tome. Telara’s personality is known as quiet and bashful. She is rather introverted and avoids appearing in public unless in the company of Zaleen or her library."
