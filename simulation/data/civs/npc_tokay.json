Their odd manner of speaking, awkward behavior, and obsession with mundane items such as clothing rather than rupees gave them a reputaion of being backwards and outright stupid. Despite their quirky demenour, the Tokay proved to be more than a pushover tribe of spear wielding reptile barbarians.",
