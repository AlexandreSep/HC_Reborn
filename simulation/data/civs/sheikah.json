					"History": "The Chief of the Yiga Clan, Master Kohga has long lived on the frontier of Hyrule and is an ardent supporter of his clan's supremacy within the Cadre. Despite his attempts the Cadre has pushed the Yiga Clan away from their council, leading him to be disillusioned with the other Clan chiefs. Kohga himself is boisterous and full of pride, though he often seeks to gain people on his side through lavish gifts, parties, and bribes."

					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The Chief of both the Kakari and Naldari Clan as well as the Sage of Shadows, Impa wields unprecedented political power within the Cadre and has long served both the Sheikah and the Royal Family of Hyrule. Perhaps the best swordsman in the history of Hyrule, her presence is often met with fear or reverence, depending on who is friend and foe. To those that do not know Impa she is seen as a cold and emotionless killer, perhaps an appearance that is a result of her extreme age and distance from society. She is in truth a very motherly figure to those that have her in their lives, perhaps an echo of a life she could have had in ages past."

					"Armament": "Katanas and Lightning",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The eldest of the Nirvata Monks and the most feared sorcerer of the Cadre, Maz Koshia has long lorded over the council of Elders and influenced the Cadre for centuries. With the exception of his brief appearances at the gathering of council, Maz Koshia lives in utter isolation deep under the earth, amassing untold dark powers. He is utterly disconnected from the rest of his kind after centuries of isolation, and none know his true motives."

Many attempts have failed, resulting in Bongo Bongo bringing havoc to Hyrule until it could be sealed away again.
