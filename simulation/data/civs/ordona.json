Latoan's iconography and influence never left the Ordonians however, and even to this day he serves as somewhat of patron saint or deity of Ordona Province. Legend says that Latoan fell into a deep sleep beneath the Ordon Spring as he and his kind were no longer needed to spiritually guide the Ordonian people. When he was active in the world, legend said that Latoan would grow vast crops in the blink of an eye, bring a healing rain forth from the sky, and summon a flock of ghostly goats to protect the borders of his land from enemies."
