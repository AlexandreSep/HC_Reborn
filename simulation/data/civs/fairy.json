	"History": "Perhaps one of Hyrule's greatest mysteries, Fairies were mythical and reclusive beings that despite being found in all corners of the world they were rarely if ever seen. Most of the time the Fairies would go about on their own with little unity or guidance, tending to nature or causing mischief when no one was looking. As the land cried out in pain however, these wild principles would gather together and cause a lot more than a little mischief.",

					"History": "Known to many as the Fairy of Winds, Sekaia appears in many cultures as the spirit that brings forth Spring and chases away the Winter. She is connected to seeds and protects the young of both plants and animals, some legends even say she gives Hylian children Boomerangs to protect themselves with until they can wield bows and arrows. She is described as a very peaceful and friendly Fairy, to children anyway. Legends say she will never appear to adults, and if one happens to catch her off guard they will find themselves in serious peril."

					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "A wild Fairy who rarely associates with other Fairies, Venus is the Queen of the Mad in many cultures and said to afflict those that seek her out with insanity. Long ago she and her fellow Mystics spread across the world and the myth goes that their isolation drove them mad with laughter and hysteria. She is described as vain and obsessed with beauty and legend says that one can summon her with ease by challenging her appearance. She is connected to the season of Summer and is said to cause the plants and animals to dance with fury under the heat of the sun."

					"Name": "Dezaia",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Fairy Claws",

					"History": "Dezaia was once a powerful Great Fairy that rivaled almost all others. Her ambitions grew too high, and she believed she could conquer Tarm itself and command the forces of nature under her will. After instigating a civil war, she was eventually defeated. As punishment for nearly tearing apart their society, Dezaia was cut off from magic and bound forever into a spider-like suit of armor that served as a prison. Before her fall, Dezaia was associated with the season of Autumn. She was said to hush animals to sleep in preparation for the dark of winter."

					"Name": "Queen of all Fairies",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Unknown",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "Little myth remains of the Queen who ruled over the Fairies of Tarm, few even know her true name. It was said that she often assumed a very childlike appearance and mannerisms, both which betrayed her overwhelming intellect and clearly god like powers. To any hero who personally met the Queen of All Fairies, she was described as curious and easily amused, filled with child like glee and wonder at encountering friendly outsiders. One individual saw through her though, he saw countless generations of war, suffering, trauma, and loss that this somber and incredibly ancient being had been a witness to. The Queen of All Fairies is associated with the season of Winter. Her presence is said to freeze all who look on her, and the land itself shivers until she passes on."
