				{
					"Name": "Nardu the White",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Sacrificial Dagger",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "Hailing from the once minuscule and politically weak Clutch of pure White, Nardu's mysterious rise to power and assumption of Matron made her family line the most recognized over night. There is much confusion around how Nardu amassed such power from nothing, but none dare confront her lest they encourage their own sacrifice at the altar. Though she can be incredibly violent, Nardu is a bit uncharacteristic for a Lizalfos. She believes all the Pantheon of gods unworthy of worship, and seeks to prove that only she herself is deserving of worship by her people."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Vakat the Winged",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Aeralfos Sword and Shield",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The last Aeralfos to have lived during the time of the old Death Mountain Empire, Vakat the Winged was once a respected leader of the Lizalfos people before the Gorons drove them into the south. Now many see him as an old fool, blaming him and the other Aeralfos for losing their homeland to the Gorons. Perhaps because of so many years of shame, Vakat is a pessimist and often spends his time in the wilderness alone. One day he wishes to find a way to restore his and his people�s status."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Talik the Red",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Dragon Lance",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "The twisted offspring of a Dinalfos and Volvagian union, Talik the Red enjoys the cowering fear she brings forth from her people due to the blood in her veins. The right hand enforcer of Nardu the White, Talik is brought in when brute force is needed to accomplish the Queen�s ends. Talik believes herself superior to all other Lizalfos kind, a trait likely encouraged by her Volvagian parentage and towering size. She holds little respect for anyone, save the White Queen. It is unknown why Talik thinks so highly of Nardu or why she so loyally serves her, but many think the key the Queen�s power lies in their cooperation."
				},
				{
					"Name": "Okakusha the Green",
					"Class": "",
					"Armament": "Faron Spear",
					"Emblem": "",
					"History": "A Chameleofos born long after the Lizalfos were driven from the north, Okakusha has defended the Faron borders most of her adult life and not thought much of the world beyond them. She follows the deity Faron rather wholeheartedly, believing her people are fortunate that he granted them a new empire in his forest. Lately Okakusha has become somewhat disturbed by the rise of Nardu the White and the increasing popularity of retaking Death Mountain. Why risk another collapse when the new Lizalfos empire is just beginning to thrive in the forest?"
