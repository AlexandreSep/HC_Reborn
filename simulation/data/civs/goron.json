					"History": "The King of the Gorons and third in the line of Fire Sages, Darunia has lead his people for over a century through countless hardships. Be it overthrowing Volvagians, or fighting off the longest winters Death Mountain has faced, there is a distinct possibility that without his leadership, the Gorons may have gone extinct. Darunia is known for his aggressive mannerisms, though he is quite jovial and friendly to those that earn his respect. Dancing is among his favorite pastimes. and he will search far and wide across Hyrule to listen to the music of other races."

					"History": "The younger brother of Darunia, Daruk was one of the many Gorons who rebelled against the Volvagian Tyrants. Though victorious in freeing his people, Daruk was furious that his brother was named a Sage for reasons that have remained personal between the two for nearly a century. A rift grew between the two brothers, and Daruk left the Death Mountain Range and wandered into seclusion. Like his brother, Daruk is quite an excited and openly friendly person. In their youth, many a hard time telling the two apart. Age has differentiated the two brothers, and Daruk now comes across as a man who has clearly lost pride in his people."

					"History": "Raised in the mines of the Death Mountain Crater, Dangoro has seen quite a life of hardship. After saving Darunia from a Dodongo trap, he was plucked out of his duty as a miner and became a guardian brother. Dangoro may not be bright, but he is quick to recognize a threat and deal with it. He traditionally wears rather heavy armor and powerful gauntlets and is not shy of ramming into and punching his targets without abandon."

					"History": "The younger brother of the legendary Biggoron, Medigoron may only be about half his size, but he still is quite large even for a Goron. He lacks the creative skill of his brother, but certainly knows how to use the weapons that Biggoron creates to great effect. He has participated in perhaps more battles than any other Goron, and shows many scars from his victories. Medigoron is a warrior and a follower, known for his ability to act out and succeed. Conversely, he's not particularly bright and lacks foresight, perhaps one of the reasons he favors being a brawler."
