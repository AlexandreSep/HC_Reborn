Sometime early in her existence, she deemed it necessary to take the Triforce into her own hands and assume control of Hyrule. She was stopped by her fellow First Sages, stripped of her powers, and banished to Hyrule forever. She proceeded to wage war against the many nations of Hyrule, eventually being slain by King Gustaf. Sulkaris had far more planned, however. After her fall, she came across the Gohma and discovered a way to unite them all under her influence. Now all Gohma exist as extensions of her will, and so long as they live she can endlessly respawn until her mission is fulfilled."
