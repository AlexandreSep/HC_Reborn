    <History>Great Fairies were amongst the most powerful Fairies of legend. Blessed with amazing intellect and an arsenal of tremendous magic, a lone Great Fairy could shape the world around it with nothing but their will power alone. Many stories claim that those who gained the favor of a Great Fairy were granted wishes. Such power tended to make Great Fairies rather egocentric, arrogant, and in worse cases; power hungry. The risk of tyrannical Great Fairies trying to take over their kind was not unheard of. </History>
