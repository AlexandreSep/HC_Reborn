    <History>Animated from the destroyed stonework of the Tarm Ruins and twisted into vaguely living shapes, the nature of these magical constructs remain a mystery. What was known is that fighting them head on was a terrible mistake. These powerful beings were resistant to most conventional weapons; it often took powerful magic in return to halt their relentless advance.</History>
