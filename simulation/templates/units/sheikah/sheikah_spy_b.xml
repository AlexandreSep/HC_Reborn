    <History>Information is the center of Sheikah culture, and their impressive networks of Spies is the means in which the Cadre carries out that tenet. Most Clans have their own Spies and have developed an entire economy of buying and selling information between clans. The Spy themselves are trained in combat, usually armed with ninjato or short sword. The Spy is Stealthed and can only be seen by Detector units and buildings, they can however see other Stealthed units.</History>
