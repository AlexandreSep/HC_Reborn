    <History>The fish-men and women of Hyrule's waters have long dominated the submerged realms. With a focus on the ideal of beauty and grace, they have crafted an Empire bent on shaping others to their extraordinary standards... A goal that has made them quite prideful and arrogant in the eyes of their land-dwelling neighbors. When convincing others fails, the Dominion has both military and magic might on their side.</History>
