    <History>Once a shining beacon of civilization in the east, Labrynna served as a Province to the Kingdom of Hyrule and important connection to the Great Sea. In recent years the Great Fairy Veran had managed to worm her way into the trust of the Labrynnian Royal Court, advancing their military might and political power. Now no longer a Province of the Kingdom of Hyrule, Labrynna plans to challenge the crown with its expanding armies.</History>
