    <History>Once the dominant power in what is now known as the Land of Famine, the Moblin's homeland was utterly devestated and left in ruins after a brutal war with the Akkalans. After centuries of slowly recovering, the Moblins and their Blin servants reunited under the guidance of the warlord Ganon. Now the united powers of Blin-kind seek to continue their relentless rampage across Hyrule.</History>
