    <History>In all the dark corners of Hyrule lurk the spider-like Gohma. Incredibly ancient, these arachnid monsters are the oldest surviving creature native to Hyrule. They were purged by even more powerful ancient forces, broken and left wandering the world as animals for countless ages. That is, until a Fallen Sage discovered a way to resurrect their lost power and use it to her own ends...</History>
