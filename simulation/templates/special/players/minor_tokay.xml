    <History>Hailing from Crescent Island just south of Labrynna, the Tokay were at first glance a tribal and primitive collection of people. Their odd manner of speaking, awkward behavior, and obsession with mundane items such as clothing rather than rupees gave them a reputaion of being backwards and outright stupid. Despite their quirky demenour, the Tokay proved to be more than a pushover tribe of spear wielding reptile barbarians.</History>
