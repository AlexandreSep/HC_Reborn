    <History>The Kingdom of the Deku Scrubs were a loose collection of feudal territories deep within the eastern reaches of the Kokiri Forest. Known for their irrational bursts of anger and their perpetual short-man's complex, large gatherings of these normally comical forest dwellers could result in terrifying destruction and chaos when unleashed on Hyrule.</History>
