    <History>Deep in the forests of eastern Hyrule rested a kingdom unlike any other. Under the guidance and lordship of the Great Deku Tree, the childlike Kokiri arrested control of the woodland realm and established a land of peace and isolation. The Great Deku Tree's utopia would not last however, and as wars ravaged the surface of Hyrule time and again, such conflict would bring the Kokiri into the field of battle.</History>
