ANCIENT RUINS
Many Ancient Ruins dot the landscape of Hyrule.
Ruins can be captured by your Units to generate Rupees. They are the main source of Rupees on most maps.
Ruins generate a small amount of Territory and can train various Armos Units.
The type of Ruins, and Armos that they can train, varies from region to region.
