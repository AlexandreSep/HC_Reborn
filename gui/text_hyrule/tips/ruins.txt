ANCIENT RUINS
Many Ancient Ruins dot the landscape of Hyrule.
Ruins can be captured by your Units to generate Rupees. They are the main source of Rupees on most maps.
Several factions (such as the Lizalfos and Stalfos), construct all of their bases on captured Ruins.
The type of Ruins varies from region to region.
