NODES
Maps are divided into Nodes, which you must capture in order to build new bases.
You must have at least one unit near a Node in order to capture and use it.
Nodes come in a large variety of types, such as Outposts, Camps, and Resource Nodes.
Some factions interact with nodes in unique ways, such as Ordona Province building Plantations on Camp Nodes.
