RESOURCES
There are a variety of resource types that are turned into Currency such as Food, Wood, Stone, and Rupees.
Resources are automatically harvested from a Node when you construct a base on them.
Each Resource type is collected and depletes at various rates. For instance Wood can be collected very fast but depletes just as quickly, Food is very slow to collect but lasts forever.
Each Faction can collect from some resources but not others. For instance Gorons cannot gather Food, and Kokiri cannot gather Stone.
