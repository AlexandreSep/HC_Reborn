Wildlife
Each Map has unique Wildlife native to its environment.
Some Wildlife is passive, and can be hunted for Food (usually Meat) or even other resources.
Predators are aggressive, and will hunt down any prey (including your Units) that they come across.
Some Wildlife can build nests and breed more of themselves. Beware, as some of these nests may be heavily defended.
